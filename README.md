# GraphAnalysis
_______________

A Java application to analyse and visualize graph/tree algorithms!

Roadmap of the project:

- [x] 1. Simple UI to create and visualize graphs
- [x] 2. Graph Search Algorithms
- [x] 3. Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms
- [x] 4. Shortest Path Algorithms
    - [x] 1. Single-Source
    - [x] 2. All-Pair
- [ ] 5. And maybe more...
